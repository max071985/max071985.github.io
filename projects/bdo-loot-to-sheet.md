Backstory: **Black Desert Online** (BDO in short), is a videogame which has a big economical system for its in-game currency - *Silver*.

I used to play this game regularely, for a long time. And i kept updating my spreadsheet data for grinding - acquiring silver from in-game monster drops,
**manually**.

Although, this "task" does not take more than 5-10 minutes to complete, I decided to challenge myself and automate it.

Progression: I took on this project early April 2021, finished core image processing. Currently put it on hold.
