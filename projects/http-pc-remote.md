***Backstory:*** 

In the summer of 2019, after graduating school, I found myself watching alot of videos/streams/movies on my PC from my bed.\
I had to get out of bed every time in order to shut down my pc / control volume, etc.\
Couldn't find an application that would make this easier, there were a few ones that managed to do what I needed,\
But they either crashed constantly or the delay was just too big for comfort.\
So, I decided to create my own really basic remote that would connect over LAN and talk over simple HTTP requests.

***Technologies:*** 

Python 3.0, Java (Android App)
